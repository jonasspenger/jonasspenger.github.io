# Zoom Secure Multi-Party Computation Study Group

## What, When and Where
We will cover the foundations of [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation), and later dive-deep on interesting hot topics.
Wednesdays, 12:00 PM UCT, @ zoom, starting on February 10, 2021. Find out more in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Ha31otCWimD3lWN5).

## Format
Each week we will meet for an open discussion of a paper/reference/topic. This will be recorded so you can watch it if you missed attending. We expect everyone to prepare by reading the paper/reference, and prepare some questions for the discussion.

## Study Plan
* Week 1: [Yao's Garbled Circuits](yaos-garbled-circuits)
* Week 2: [BGW Protocol and Beaver Triples](bgw-protocol-and-beaver-triples)
* Week 3: SPDZ (malicious BGW)
* Week 4: TBD
