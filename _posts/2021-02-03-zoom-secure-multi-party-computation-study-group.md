# Zoom Secure Multi-Party Computation Study Group

**When and where:** Wednesdays, 12:00 PM UCT, @ zoom, starting on February 10, 2021. Find out more in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Ha31otCWimD3lWN5 ), and keep up-to-date by subscribing to the [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=NHJmZTk0cnUxMWZhZ3U0a3Z0YzhkcmFwaXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ
).

**What:** We will cover the foundations of [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation), and later dive-deep on interesting hot topics.

**Format:** Each week we will meet for an open discussion of a paper/reference/topic. This will be recorded so you can watch it if you miss attending. We expect everyone to prepare by reading the paper/reference, and prepare some questions for the discussion. We also encourage active discussions before and after the meeting.

**Current study plan:** We are working our way through chapter 3 of the [Pragmatic MPC](https://securecomputation.org/) book.
