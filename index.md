# Hello!
I am an industrial PhD student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, employed by RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. My supervisors are Assoc. Prof. Philipp Haller and Asst. Prof. Paris Carbone. I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.

My research interests are programming languages, distributed/decentralized systems, and secure multi-party computation. My free time interests are long-distance running, listening to music, eating good food, and resting.

I am currently working on Portals, check out the project website for more information: [www.portals-project.org](https://www.portals-project.org/). The title for our paper summarizes the Portals project well: “[Portals: An Extension of Dataflow Streaming for Stateful Serverless](https://people.kth.se/~jspenger/pdfs/spenger2022portals.pdf).” It provides a good introduction to the programming model and system.

This is my personal website. Here you can find my [blog](blog), and information on how to [contact](contact) me.
