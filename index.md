# Hello, World!
I am an industrial PhD student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/profile/jspenger), employed by [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/jonas-spenger). My supervisors are [Assoc. Prof. Philipp Haller](https://www.kth.se/profile/phaller) and [Asst. Prof Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc). I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de).

My research interests are distributed/decentralized systems, programming languages, and secure multi-party computation. I am currently working on stateful serverless systems.
