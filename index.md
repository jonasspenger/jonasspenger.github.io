# Hello!
I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My supervisors are Assoc. Prof. Philipp Haller and Asst. Prof. Paris Carbone. I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I used to work at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden.

My research interests are programming languages, distributed/decentralized systems, and secure multi-party computation / cryptography. My free time interests are long-distance running and listening to music.

I am currently working on Portals, check out the project website for more information: [www.portals-project.org](https://www.portals-project.org/). The title for our paper summarizes the Portals project well: “[Portals: An Extension of Dataflow Streaming for Stateful Serverless](https://people.kth.se/~jspenger/pdfs/spenger2022portals.pdf).” It provides a good introduction to the programming model and system.

This is my personal website. Here you can find my [blog](blog), and information on how to [contact](contact) me. I don't have much time to update the website nowadays, you can track my activity on other platforms instead.
